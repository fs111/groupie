# groupie simple group by for the command line

groupie does one simple thing. Read lines from stdin, counts and groups them. When stdin is closed it prints the groups
and their counts found in the stream. This is very useful for a quick frequency analyis like so:

```
$ some-command |  groupie
1 foo
4 bar
7 quux
```

groupie does only one thing well. If you need sorted output pipe its output to `sort -n` or `sort -nr`.

That's it. Yes, one can do `sort | uniq -c | sort -n`, but groupie is faster since you need one sort less.
